## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This one was a good challenge, because I didn't expect to face any problems doing that but I was wrong! The top and bottom circle patterns challenged me to learn more about positioning (especially `fixed`). I also learn about `absolute` position in `css` and the fact that it follows the rules of its parent and I should make its parent `relative`.
