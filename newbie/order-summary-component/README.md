## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For the first challenge, I had pretty much easy time for development. The only part that challenged me was limiting texts inside the card and I handle that with `ch` unit which is an awesome feature of CSS!

### Useful resources

- [HTML Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) - This helped me for writing semantic HTML.
- [Keep the Footer at the Bottom](https://moderncss.dev/keep-the-footer-at-the-bottom-flexbox-vs-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me to put footer at the bottom of the page. Although I decided not to do that but it still help me for making a better page layout. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Using SVG](https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/) - I use this great article from CSS-Tricks to add svg images to the page.
- [Responsive Typography](https://dev.to/laurilllll/how-to-create-responsive-typography-using-css-three-different-methods-explained-50f8) - Finally, this article gave me a great idea of how to make my webpage typography responsive. I used the second aproach and I plan to use the third one for my next projects as it turns out to be a better solution!
