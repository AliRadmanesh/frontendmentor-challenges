## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Image (`<Picture>` tag)
- CSS blend modes

### What I learned

This one challenged me in two parts: first is how to make images responsive which I did that using `picture` tag, the second part is how to add a filter to the image that is pretty much straight forward by using CSS `blend-mode`. 

### Useful resources

- [Picturefill: A responsive image polyfill](https://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) - This library is used as a polyfill for `<picture>` tag that can be used in responsive images.
- [Web.dev CSS Blend Modes](https://web.dev/learn/css/blend-modes/) - Great resource for learning blend modes and CSS in general!
